# Changelog

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed smart and minimal snapshot modes** — only full mode remains. Smart mode silently collapsed elements (hiding them from the AI), causing missed assertions and inability to interact with hidden refs. Minimal mode stripped all tree hierarchy, losing context about element location on the page. Both produced unreliable results even on simple pages. The `SnapshotMode` type, `SELENIUM_MCP_SNAPSHOT_MODE` env var, `snapshotOptions.mode` parameter, and `snapshotMode` config option have all been removed.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-19

### Breaking Changes

- **Element discovery module refactored** — the monolithic `src/utils/element-discovery.ts` (1339 lines) has been split into a modular `src/utils/element-discovery/` directory with dedicated files for selector computation, tree scripts, formatting, and element resolution. Import paths have changed from `./utils/element-discovery.js` to `./utils/element-discovery/index.js`. Public API remains identical.
- **Max discoverable elements increased** from 200 to 300, improving coverage on complex pages.

### New Features

- **`teach_selector` tool** — Teach the system a preferred CSS selector for any element. The selector is validated in-browser (must match exactly 1 visible element), then saved to a per-domain hints file (`selector-hints.json`). Taught selectors are used as Phase 0 (highest priority) in future element discovery, ensuring stable, user-chosen selectors take precedence over auto-computed ones.
  - Auto-determines scope: elements in `<header>`, `<nav>`, or `<footer>` default to site-wide (`*`), while content elements default to the current path pattern.
  - Supports manual scope override (e.g., `"/blog/*"`, `"*"`).
  - Idempotent: re-teaching the same CSS selector updates the existing hint.

- **Selector hints system** (`src/utils/selector-hints.ts`) — A persistent, domain-scoped hint storage system:
  - Hints are stored as JSON keyed by domain and path pattern.
  - On every page snapshot, hints for the current domain+path are loaded and passed to element discovery as Phase 0 candidates.
  - Simple glob matching for path scopes (e.g., `/blog/*` matches `/blog/my-post`).
  - Non-critical: hint loading failures are silently ignored to avoid breaking snapshots.

### Semantic Element Recognition Improvements

- **Visibility-aware uniqueness** — Selector uniqueness now checks only *visible* elements. Previously `querySelectorAll().length === 1` counted hidden elements, causing valid selectors to be skipped and falling back to fragile XPath text matchers. Now `cssUnique()` and `xpathUnique()` filter by visibility (non-zero size, not `display:none`/`visibility:hidden`/`opacity:0`), producing more accurate and human-readable CSS selectors.

- **Ancestor scope fallback** — New `findAncestorScope()` walks up the DOM to find the nearest scoping ancestor (by `#id`, semantic attributes like `data-testid`, landmark with `aria-label`, or positional landmark). All selector phases now try unscoped first, then scoped. This means duplicate elements (e.g., "Home" link in both header nav and footer) now get proper scoped selectors like `nav[aria-label="Main navigation"] a[href="/"]` instead of falling through to fragile XPath `normalize-space()` matchers.

- **Shadow DOM support** — The accessibility tree walker now traverses open shadow roots, discovering elements inside web components. `computeSelector()` detects shadow DOM context, scopes CSS queries within the shadow root, uses `>>>` notation for cross-boundary selectors, and disables XPath (which cannot cross shadow boundaries).

- **Two-pass ref assignment** — Semantic elements (links, buttons, headings, landmarks) get refs first in pass 1. Generic elements discovered via test attributes (`data-testid`, `data-test`, `data-cy`, `data-qa`) or custom elements (tags with hyphens) are deferred to pass 2, filling remaining ref budget without stealing slots from higher-priority semantic elements.

- **Generic element discovery** — Elements with test-anchor attributes (`data-testid`, `data-test`, `data-cy`, `data-qa`) or custom HTML elements (web components with hyphenated tags) are now discovered with role `generic`, even without an ARIA role or interactivity. Fallback naming uses the test attribute value, then any meaningful attribute.

- **Phase 2b: byDescendantTestId** — When an element itself lacks a test ID but a direct child has one, uses CSS `:has(> child[data-testid="..."])` selector for modern browsers, with XPath fallback.

- **Phase 16: byPositionalIndex** — New last-resort fallback when all 15 phases fail. Finds the element's position among all matches of a good base selector (test ID, text match) and produces `(xpath)[N]` positional selectors.

- **Deeper positional chain** — Phase 14 (byIndex) now walks up to 5 ancestor levels (was 2) and adds `nth-of-type` to ancestor nodes that have same-tag siblings, producing more precise positional selectors.

- **Explicit role handling in Phase 3** — Elements with explicit `role` attributes (e.g., `div[role="button"]`) are now handled in the byRole+name phase even when the tag has no implicit role mapping.

- **`hreflang` attribute support** — Added to attribute priority list, enabling CSS selectors like `a[hreflang="nl"]` for language switcher links instead of falling back to XPath text matching.

### Architecture

- **Element discovery split into modules:**
  - `element-discovery/index.ts` — barrel exports (public API unchanged)
  - `element-discovery/discover.ts` — `discoverElements()` with selector hints support
  - `element-discovery/selector-scripts.ts` — browser-side `computeSelector()` (16-phase selector computation)
  - `element-discovery/tree-scripts.ts` — browser-side accessibility tree walker with two-pass ref assignment
  - `element-discovery/format-tree.ts` — `formatAccessibilityTree()` with full/smart/minimal modes
  - `element-discovery/element-scripts.ts` — `extractElementInfo()` and `findElementByInfo()`
