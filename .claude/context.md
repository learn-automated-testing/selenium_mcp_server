## Guardrails

Project-specific things the agents must never do, or must always do. Examples:

- Never commit secrets, `.env` files, or API keys
- All async functions must have error handling
- All external API calls wrapped in try/catch with meaningful error messages
- Money stored as integer cents, never floats
- Timestamps always in UTC
