# Skill: review

## Purpose
Review code for quality, security, maintainability, and correctness. Catch problems before they reach production.

## When to trigger this skill
- User says "review this", "check my code", "PR review", "what's wrong with this"
- Before merging a branch
- After a vibe coding session to catch AI-generated issues
- When code feels fragile or hard to understand

## Prerequisites
- Access to the code to be reviewed
- Understanding of the tech stack in use
- Ideally: access to the feature spec or user story this code implements

## Steps

1. **Understand the intent first**
   - Read the PR description or ask: "What is this code supposed to do?"
   - Review against the spec, not just against itself

2. **Check correctness**
   - Does it actually do what it's supposed to do?
   - Are there obvious logic errors or off-by-one issues?
   - Are edge cases handled: empty arrays, null values, zero, very large numbers?

3. **Check security**
   - User input: is everything validated and sanitised before use?
   - SQL: are queries parameterised? No string concatenation into queries.
   - Auth: are protected routes actually protected?
   - Secrets: no API keys, passwords, or tokens hardcoded or logged
   - Dependencies: any new packages added? Are they well-maintained?

4. **Check code quality**
   - Is the code readable without needing comments to explain it?
   - Are functions small and single-purpose?
   - Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?
   - Are variable and function names clear and consistent?
   - Is error handling present and meaningful?

5. **Check for regressions**
   - Does this change touch shared utilities or global state?
   - Could it break existing behaviour elsewhere?
   - Are there tests covering the changed code?

6. **Check performance (if relevant)**
   - Any N+1 database queries?
   - Any blocking operations on the main thread?
   - Large data sets handled with pagination?

7. **Deliver the review**
   - Group findings by severity: critical → warning → suggestion
   - Be specific: quote the line, explain the problem, suggest the fix
   - Praise what's done well — this builds trust and signals what to repeat

## Rules and constraints
- Never approve code with a critical security issue
- Never approve code with no error handling on external calls
- Be kind — the goal is better code, not to make someone feel bad
- Focus on patterns, not just individual lines
- Do not rewrite the entire code — flag issues and let the author fix

## Severity levels

| Level | Meaning | Must fix before merge? |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| Critical | Security hole, data loss risk, broken functionality | Yes |
| Warning | Bad practice, likely future bug, missing error handling | Strongly recommended |
| Suggestion | Style, readability, minor improvements | Optional |

## Output format
```
Code review: UserAuthService.js
───────────────────────────────

CRITICAL (1)
  Line 47: Password is logged to console before hashing.
  This will expose plaintext passwords in your logs.
  Fix: remove console.log(password) on line 47.

WARNING (2)
  Line 23: No error handling on the database call.
  If the DB is down, this will throw an unhandled exception.
  Fix: wrap in try/catch and return a meaningful error response.

  Line 61: Magic number 86400 — what is this?
  Fix: extract to a named constant: TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 86400

SUGGESTION (1)
  Line 12-34: This function is doing three things.
  Consider splitting into validateInput(), hashPassword(), saveUser().

Overall: good structure, clean naming. Fix the critical issue before merging.
